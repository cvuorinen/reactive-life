# Reactive Life

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life with RxJS and Angular.

A personal study project to learn and try out reactive programming and RxJS.
You can take a look at the code if interested, there is a lot of room for improvement,
especially the reactive stuff I'm still learning about.

Here is a live demo: http://cvuorinen.github.io/reactive-life/

## TODO

* Angular2 and/or React version (to benchmark performance)
* Use ES6 and/or TypeScript
